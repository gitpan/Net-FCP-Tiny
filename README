NAME
    Net::FCP::Tiny - A Tiny and incomplete interface to the Freenet Client
    Protocol (FCPv2)

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::FPC::Tiny;

        my $fcp = Net::FCP::Tiny->new(
            name => 'Freenet Munin Plugin',
            host => $ENV{FREENET_HOST},
            port => $ENV{FREENET_PORT},
        );

        my $info = $fcp->array2hash($fcp->send_msg(<<'END'));
    GetNode
    WithPrivate=false
    WithVolatile=true
    EndMessage
    END

        print "Java is using ", $info->{"volatile.usedJavaMemory"}, " bytes of memory";

DESCRIPTION
    This is a tiny (~60 line) and stupid wrapper that talks the Freenet
    Client Protocol. It sets up a communication channel for you, and you can
    send messages <http://new-wiki.freenetproject.org/FCPv2> by copy/pasting
    examples from the FCPv2 docs.

    I wrote it for a munin plugin
    <http://github.com/avar/munin-plugin-freenet> because Net::FCP was
    ancient, and AnyEvent::FCP hurt my brain.
